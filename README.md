+ Python code used to parse sample test cases of Codechef locally.This is primarily done to ease the running of sample test cases during Long Challenges/Short Challenges.

+ Running the file: Make sure the .cpp and the .py files are in the same directory including the source code.

+ Execution:  ```python webcrawler.py ```

+ For every subsequent compilation of the program execute the following shell script:  ``` ./run.sh ```

+ Demonstration of the project can be found here: [video](https://youtu.be/gVnlKnDRTF4)

+ Contributors : Siddhartha Chowdhuri , Elvis Menezes.

+ Future Work:  Handling of multiple input files and other test cases.
